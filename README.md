# I Want a Better Catastrophe

**_A flowchart for navigating our climate predicament_**

Global warming is projected to rocket past the 1.5°C limit, throwing lifelong activist [Andrew Boyd](https://bettercatastrophe.com/) into a crisis of hope, and off on a quest to learn how to live with the “impossible news” of climate breakdown. With gallows humor and a broken heart, Andrew steers us through our climate angst as he walks his own. This flowchart, which combines an audio narration with interactive elements, is an invitation to join him on his narrative path and explore our predicament on your own.
